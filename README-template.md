## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### Continued development

I want to gradually master building CSS Grid layouts, and making them responsive.

### Useful resources

-   [Kevin Powell: Learn CSS Grid the easy way!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This was a very well broken down video which explained only the main concepts that you need to get started with CSS Grid. Just like the title says it teaches you the easiest way to get started with grid and teaches you all the main values and properties you need to know. It's an excellent resource.
